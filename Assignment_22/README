##  Gmail Setup

> For security, Gmail now requires **App Passwords** for access via scripts.

1. Go to: [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Generate an app password for **"Mail" > "Other (Custom name)"**.
3. Copy that password. Use it instead of your Gmail password in the script.

## Usage

```bash
python script_name.py <DirectoryPath>
